## 1. Purpose

This document defines the detailed technical design for implementing CBOP based on the approved Business Requirement Document (BRD).

---

## 2. Intended Audience

- Solution Architects
- Technical Leads
- Developers
- QA Team
- Database & Infrastructure Teams
- Security Review Teams

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

CBOP follows a layered architecture with strict separation between presentation, business logic, domain, and infrastructure layers.

---

## 4. Logical Architecture Layers

### 4.1 Presentation Layer
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Razor Views
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Role-based UI rendering

### 4.2 Application Layer
- Business rules
- Transaction validation
- Approval workflows
- Authorization enforcement

### 4.3 Domain Layer
- Core entities (Customer, Account, Transaction)
- Business rules & invariants
- Enums and value objects

### 4.4 Infrastructure Layer
- EF Core (Oracle Provider)
- Encryption services
- File storage
- Logging and reporting

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication
- ASP.NET Core Identity
- Cookie-based authentication
- Secure password hashing (PBKDF2)

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Policy-based approval checks  
  Example policy: `HighValueTransactionApproval`

---

## 6. Security Design

- AES encryption for PAN, Aadhaar, Account Numbers
- Encryption at application layer
- Secure key management via Data Protection API
- HTTPS and CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization

## 7. Transaction Workflow

### Maker–Checker Model

| Role | Action |
|----|-------|
| Teller | Initiates transaction |
| System | Evaluates limits |
| Manager | Approves / Rejects |

### Workflow States
- Initiated
- Pending Approval
- Approved
- Rejected

---

## 8. Audit & Logging

- Append-only audit logs
- Dedicated AUDIT_LOG table
- No update or delete permissions
- Separation of audit and error logs

---

## 9. Reporting

- Application-layer report generation
- PDF and Excel formats
- Preview before download

---

## 10. Deployment Model

| Component | Deployment |
|--------|------------|
| Web App | IIS Express / Kestrel |
| Database | Oracle XE |
| Logs | File-based |
| Documents | Secured local storage |

---

## 11. Conclusion

The solution design ensures security, auditability, scalability, and maintainability while remaining aligned with enterprise banking standards.
